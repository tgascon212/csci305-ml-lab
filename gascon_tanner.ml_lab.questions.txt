Assignment: ML Lab Questions

1) val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list
2) f returns a list where each element is incremented by 1. i.e. 3 becomes 4, 1 becomes 2....
3) line (a) defines a function that takes in a list and outputs a list.
4) line (b) returns an empty list if the list is empty or adds 1 to each element in the list and returns the updated list.
5) False was the output because "one" != "1"
6) it uses head recursion
7) { best times, it was the worst of times }
8) The tail recursive functions considered better than non-tail recursive functions because tail-recursion can be optimized by compiler since the recursive call is the last statement. Therefore there is nothing left to do in the current function, so saving the current functionâ€™s stack frame is not needed.
9){ green eggs and ham }
10){ and macaroni }
11) I enjoyed that ML wasnt that hard to pick up and learn the basics and the setup for my mac went relatively smooth
12) I did not like the way that errors were displayed or that it can be hard to know exactly what ML is looking for in a variable at times.
13) I didnt mind this lab as once you figure out ML its not a terribly hard language, however my dislikes come from the errors. Figuring out what some errors mean can be difficult and requrie a ton of looking up.
14) I spent about 6-7 hours on this lab, where most of this time was spent understanding ML
15) Unless required by some company I dont currently have any use for ML.
